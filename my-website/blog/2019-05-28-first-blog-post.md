## From Digital AI to Embodied Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is moving beyond screens and chatbots into the physical world through **Physical AI** — intelligent systems capable of **seeing, thinking, navigating, and acting** inside real environments.

Humanoid robots now combine perception, reasoning, and control to:

✅ Interpret human voice commands  
✅ Navigate spaces using SLAM  
✅ Identify objects using depth cameras  
✅ Perform physical manipulation safely

## The Technology Stack Behind Physical AI

Modern humanoid robotics depends on tightly integrated systems:

### 🤖 ROS 2 — Robot Nervous System  
Real-time communication between robot sensors, planners, and controllers.

### 🧠 Isaac Sim & Gazebo  
Photorealistic simulation environments to develop and train robots before real deployment.

### 👁 Vision Sensors & LiDAR  
Depth perception enabling obstacle detection, navigation, and grasp targeting.

### 🗣️ Wishper & GPT  
Converting spoken commands into robotic action using intelligent planning.

## Vision-Language-Action Pipeline

The VLA pipeline is the backbone of Physical AI:

1. Speech captured via microphones  
2. Whisper converts voice to commands  
3. GPT plans task execution  
4. ROS Actions move actuators  
5. Sensors provide feedback loops

This pipeline enables everyday commands like:

> _"Navigate to the desk and bring me the object."_
