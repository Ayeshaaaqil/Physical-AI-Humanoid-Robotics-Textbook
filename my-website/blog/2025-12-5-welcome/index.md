## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

This blog introduces you to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** — a curriculum designed to bridge **digital intelligence and physical embodiment**. Here, students explore how **AI agents** can perceive, reason, and act in real environments.

Through this program, you will learn to:

✅ Control robots using **ROS 2**  
✅ Build digital twins in **Gazebo & Unity**  
✅ Train humanoids using **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**  
✅ Integrate **Vision-Language-Action pipelines** with GPT models

## How Our Blog Works

All blog posts are organized to provide:

- Step-by-step tutorials for **Physical AI modules**  
- Research insights from humanoid robotics labs  
- Case studies of autonomous robot deployments  
- Detailed guides on **edge computing and sensor integration**  

You can organize your posts using **tags**, such as:

- `physical-ai`  
- `humanoid`  
- `simulation`  
- `ros2`  
- `vla`
